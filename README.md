# Exploration as Empowerment

Project at the Computational Principles for Intelligence lab in Tübingen, GER.
This code and data can be used to replicate the results from "Intrinsically Motivated Exploration as Empowerment" by Brändle, Stocks, Tenenbaum, Gershman and Schulz.

## Installation
Install the requirements from "requirements.txt".

## data
Most behavioral data and generated data necessary to exactly replicate the results from the paper can be found at https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/28c50dc3a6bf4d10995d/ . Copy all the folders labeled "data" in the respective sub folders. Additionally copy the folder "fastText" into the resources subfolder.
The behavioral data of the ~29000 participants of the original game can be shared upon reasonable request by contacting me via "franziska.braendle@tuebingen.mpg.de"

## Usage
Run models with
`python -m empowermentexploration.models`

Run gametrees with
`python -m explorationempowerment.gametree`

More detailed instructions will follow in the near future.
